# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Beks- a Data Scientis/Programmer for AlphabetSoup- an orgazation that has donated over a billion dollars to oragazation and foundation that help the envirnement,the wellbeings of others and unified/beutify the world. The CEO asked Beks if she could analyize and vet every oragazation and foundation that they donated too and predict where to make investments. 

Beks has received dataset with over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet. The CEO asked Beks if she could:

1. Determine which orgazation / foundation to donate too
2. Determine which orgazation/ Foundation is a high risk?  

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
